# SemarSecOrch

**SemarSecOrch** is an experimental cybersecurity platform designed to provide seamless orchestration and integration of open-source tools for advanced threat detection, log correlation, and automated incident response. Inspired by the wisdom and protection embodied by Semar, a prominent character in Javanese wayang mythology, this platform aims to deliver a robust and reliable solution for modern cybersecurity challenges.

## Key Features

1. **Log Collection and Analysis**  
   - Aggregates logs from various sources such as Windows and Linux servers, Web Application Firewalls (WAF), and network firewalls.
   - Provides in-depth log analysis for identifying potential threats.

2. **Security Event Correlation**  
   - Integrates multiple tools to correlate security events across different systems for better visibility.

3. **Automated Incident Response (SOAR)**  
   - Leverages Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) to block attackers in real time and create actionable cases.

4. **Case Management and Ticketing**  
   - Generates cases for confirmed threats and provides ticketing for follow-up analysis and remediation.

5. **Threat Intelligence Integration**  
   - Incorporates Indicators of Compromise (IoC) and threat intelligence from sources like MISP and OpenCTI.

## Technology Stack

- **Wazuh**: Log collection and endpoint security monitoring.
- **Graylog & OpenSearch**: Log ingestion and search for non-agent-based endpoints.
- **Grafana**: Visualization and central event correlation.
- **Shuffle SOAR**: Automation for threat mitigation and case creation.
- **IRIS**: Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) case management.
- **MISP/OpenCTI**: Threat intelligence and IoC enrichment.
